# Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem - EME

The Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem (EME) is an open-source software platform designed to facilitate timely secure incident reporting and management, online communication and collaboration, and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing among cybersecurity authorities, incident response teams, and critical infrastructure operators from within a single distributed platform. It integrates aÂ  number of advanced tools to enhance the management, analysis and sharing of cybersecurity incidents and the structured communication of threat intelligence, thereby enhancing situational awareness, timely response and attack impact minimization.

The Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem has resulted from the [EU-funded H2020 IRIS project, GA No: 101021727](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101021727). The IRIS project aimed to deliver a framework to support European CERT and CSIRT networks detecting, sharing, responding and recovering from cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities of IoT and AI-driven systems within smart cities, interacting with the respective Critical Infrastructure Operators. 




## Other IRIS Project Exploitable Service Bundles

The resulting IRIS project platform has been an all in one integrated and distributed ecosystem with loosely coupled architecture, enabling:
* Automated diverse vulnerabilities and threat/attack detection on IoT and AI-driven infrastructures of smart cities (cross CI). 
* Semi-automated, secure and timely CTI and Incidents Information Sharing and Reporting among Need to Know Stakeholders (OES and CERTs/CSIRTs). This is 
* Enhanced and Timely Cyber Situational Awareness and Online Collaboration among Need to Know Stakeholders (OES and CERTs/CSIRTs) to manage a threat/incident
* Closing the loop: Semi-automated response policies execution and acknowledgement of detected vulnerabilities and threats
