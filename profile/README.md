# Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem - EME

The Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem (EME) is an open-source software platform designed to facilitate timely secure communication, collaboration, and cyber threat intelligence (CTI) sharing among cybersecurity authorities, incident response teams, and critical infrastructure operators from within a single distributed platform. It integrates aÂ  number of advanced tools to enhance the management, analysis and sharing of cybersecurity incidents and the structured communication of threat intelligence, thereby enhancing situational awareness and timely response and attack impact minimization capabilities.

The Enhanced MeliCERTes Ecosystem has resulted from the EU-funded H2020 IRIS project (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101021727).
